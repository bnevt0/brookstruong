```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Objectives
1. Develop and deploy a classification model an a product purchase data set.
2. End to end analysis using R
3. Learn the `caret` package for ML
4. Learn to present the case using Rmarkdown

## Read in the dataset

```{r Read in the dataset, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)      #used by Caret
library(ggplot2)

setwd("~/Documents/brookstruong")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
